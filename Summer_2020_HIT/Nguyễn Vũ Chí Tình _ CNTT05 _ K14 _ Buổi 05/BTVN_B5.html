                <h1>Levi Ackerman</h1>
                <p>Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut curtain, as well as narrow, intimidating
                    dull gray eyes with dark circles under them and a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short, but
                    his physique is well-developed in musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment usage.
                    He is usually either frowning or expressionless; that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, often makes
                    it difficult for others to guess what he is thinking.He is most often seen in his Survey Corps
                    uniform, with a light gray button-up shirt underneath along with his trademark white ascot. When
                    embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak.
                    Once, when forced to take leave from his duties due to injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain
                    white shirt, ascot, and dress shoes.[citation needed] However, since the beginning of the coup
                    d'état, he has left the ascot off. For most of the time during which the Survey Corps was on the run
                    from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical maneuvering equipment harness over
                    casual clothes.[citation needed]</p>
